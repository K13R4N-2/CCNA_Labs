# **CCNA_Labs**
I will be posting all of my own custom packet tracer labs here as I progress through studying CCNA via Jeremy's IT Lab.

## **NOTES**
- I will score my labs from my personal point of vew out of **5**.
- **5** = Difficult, **1** = Easy
- All labs are built by myself. I will be creating my labs from scratch for each topic I cover whilst studying.
