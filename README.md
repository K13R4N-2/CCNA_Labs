# **CCNA Labs**
- I will be posting all of my own custom packet tracer labs here as I progress through studying CCNA via Jeremy's IT Lab.
- All labs are built by myself. I will be creating my labs from scratch for each topic I cover whilst studying.
- Only Cisco device configuration labs will be posted here. Network theory is through my own personal notes.
  
## **Note**
- I will score my labs from my personal point of vew out of **5**.
- **5** = Difficult, **1** = Easy
