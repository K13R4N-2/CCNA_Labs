# **CCNA Labs**
- I will be posting all of my own custom packet tracer labs here as I progress through studying CCNA via Jeremy's IT Lab.
- All labs are built by myself. I will be creating my labs from scratch for each topic I cover whilst studying. Basic network connectivity (inter-vlan routing) will not be show in each lab#s command section, unless lab is inter-vlan routing.
- Only Cisco device configuration labs will be posted here. Network theory is through my own personal notes.
- My end goal will be to create a mega lab including all lab-based CCNA topics.
